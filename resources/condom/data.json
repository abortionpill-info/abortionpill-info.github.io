  {"tit": "What are male condoms?", "con": "u2018A condom is a thin rubber (latex or poly urethane) balloon that fits over the penis when the penis is erect. The condom stops\n\u2018sperm from entering the vagina, so it prevents pregnancy. Condoms are 98% effective in preventing pregnancy if used\ncorrectly (every time a couple has sex). Because sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are passed on through fluids mixing\n\n\u00abduring vaginal, oral or anal sex, condoms also protect against these infections. In fact, male condoms and female condoms\nare the only kind of contraception that provides protection against STIs."},
